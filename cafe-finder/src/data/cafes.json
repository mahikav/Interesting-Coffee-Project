      "Small cafe in Berkeley with a beautiful, minimalist, modern interior.\n\nFinals week is this week, and I needed somewhere with ample seating, outlets, free WiFi, and a calm vibe. Mind Coffee delivered on everything I needed! It also helps that many other college students were studying or working when I came around 6pm. I also like that they're open late (10pm) compared to other cafes in the area.\n\nI ordered the inner peace tea which comes in a small glass carafe. Very calming and I liked the inclusion of kava root! Would definitely come back. (:",
      "In spite of its terrible parking situation and very limited seating availability, Mind is one of the more popular study spots in the area. Definitely consider walking or taking public transit, and if you do decide to drive, know that the meter maids here are particularly active - one visit I saw 3 cars around me get ticketed in a two hour time span. There are only 4 regular tables, with the rest of the seating options being firm beanbags and knee-high surfaces.\n\nMind has some of the closest interior decor I've seen to some of my favorite coffee shops in LA - a clean, bright aesthetic that showcases their process. Staff are lovely and willing to answer any questions, and although drinks do take a little longer to come out they're worth the wait.\n\nCardamom Matcha Mindspanner: a personalized seasonal recommendation from one of their baristas. Matcha and cardamom taste were evenly matched and perfectly sweet - the matcha in particular tasted fairly high quality. Whipped cream was fantastic and very spoonable.\n\nHojicha Mindspanner: wanted to see how they would do one of my favorite flavors and Mind did not disappoint. Flavor was authentic and not overwhelming. See above for notes on cream.\n\nWill be back!",
      "Solid coffee shop near campus. It is small so unless you're there early and camp out, you're not likely to find a spot to do work. Also some of their spots are little cushions on the ground and not the most comfortable for spending more than 5 minutes there.\n\nYou order at a little kiosk near the counter. Straightforward and no problems. I got a regular latte and a twice baked hazelnut chocolate croissant. Decent latte, was pricey but about average for Berkeley. The croissant while amazingly delicious was incredibly rich. Maybe share it with a friend and definitely have something caffeinated to cut through the richness.\n\nGive it a shot! But maybe take it to go and find somewhere else to work."

      "I got the chai with a shot of espresso for my first time visit at SoDol, and the coffee tasted so rich and amazing!\n\nThe interior is very interesting and fun! Lots of space to do work. Service was ok!",
      "Tucked away in an alley, SoDoI Coffee Tasting House is easy to miss unless you know to keep an eye out for it. I eventually found my way by following the signs in the alley - and saw that many others had also discovered this hidden coffee shop since all of the tables inside were filled. It took a while to place my order; while there was no line, all of the baristas were incredibly busy preparing a long queue of drinks. After waiting a few minutes, I placed my order for a drip coffee and waited another ten minutes or so for my coffee (Note: drip coffee refers to a pour-over). My coffee tasted really smooth and strong - almost like espresso.\n\nThe coffee shop seemed to be filled with students preparing for midterms, but I could also envision this as a nice setting for a coffee meet-up with friends. While I was in a hurry during this most recent visit, I'll plan ahead next time and linger at one of the tables as I enjoy my coffee.",
      "SoDoI is spacious coffee place with a lot of seating and huge tables, definitely great to come and study. The French toast iced coffee was good and in the sweet side so if you like the strong coffee flavor I recline to ask it for less sweater. The baristas here were really nice and helpful with deciding what to get and they were very welcoming. If you're in the Berkeley area I definitely recommend checking this place out."

      "so nice to see more cute cafes opening up in berkeley! had the strawberry matcha and the grilled pork banh mi and both were super yummy! def hope to try more of their stuff in the future :)\n\nwent around noon and there was no line to order which was nice! drinks and food came out super quick too. there were a couple seats open but most tables were occupied so not sure if it would be the best place to study. highly recommend regardless!",
      "Stumbled upon this place looking for coffee near UCB. I'm super impressed by this coffee shop! Binge Coffee House offers unique Asian flavors for coffee and drinks.\n\nI ordered their seasonal white peach drink which was a bit too sweet for my liking, but you can always adjust the sugar level. My friends ordered the banana matcha latte, which was also sweet, so we do recommend less sugar if you have less of a sweet tooth.\n\nCute family owned shop with some tables available for studying. It was fairly crowded with students on a weekend afternoon. Customer service was also really good with reasonable wait time for drinks.",
      "Got to check this place out and got a drink for our little stroll through the neighborhood. It is packed with students, mostly. Small shop with people waiting for their orders while also being in the way of the 2 kiosks to place your order. Definitely some weaving through the crowd is necessary. Not the ideal place to do some laptop work, but there were definitely some folks in there making it work.\n\nNo desk person to speak to, mainly self service. They serve up the drinks pretty fast but then disappear to the back again. They also offer some light snacks too, like the egg puffs. Drinks are good but not worth a special trip, esp fighting through students to order and get your order."

      "Super yummy drink! I got the Up All Night which is Thai tea & Thai coffee. Perfect blend of flavors for me. There's a few tables inside & I was able to study for a few hours. The worker was very nice.",
      "I came by recently and the woman at the front was very kind, she suggested the peppermint Thai milk tea (still available from the winter menu)! She said it was her favorite so I was really sold on it, plus I've never had peppermint flavored Thai milk tea before and I really love trying new and unique flavor combinations. Turns out, peppermint goes very well with Thai milk tea. It is a small space, with a few small tables on one side of the room. When we were there on a Sunday afternoon all the small tables were taken and it looked like everyone was studying.",
      "I love Thai tea, imma just put that out there. The fact that Cha Thai Tea specializes in it and is close to my home? Dangerous!\n\nI came here with my best friend and we enjoyed sipping in their shop. The inside is pretty minimalistic and quiet. There's a few tables inside and a couple outside. Since we were one of the only customers, my drink came out fast.\n\nWhen you come to a place with Thai tea as their name, best believe I'm going to try it! I had the Oat Milk Thai Tea. Initially I asked for no sugar but it was definitely too bitter for me so they were kind enough to add some sweet syrup. You can taste the pureness of the tea. It was high quality for sure and I recommend it for those seeking authentic Thai tea.\n\nAfter my experience at Cha Thai Tea, I will continue to bring other friends who also love Thai tea. The shop is small but easy to find off Shattuck Ave. with street parking around. Can't wait to come back to try their other drinks!"

There are outlets all along the walls, but not many in the taller tables/counters along the walls. Also, some tables in the middle look like they require reservations.\n\nFlamecraft mocha: hot chocolate with cayenne and cinnamon. spicy in a good way! gets the immune system going and warms the body for a good study sesh.\n\nEmployees seem friendly, nothing super standout about service, good vibes all around tho."

Glad that the students haven't taken over the cafe like they have in other places. You can actually buy food and sit down and enjoy it instead of doing take out due to lack of seating. Places to sit inside and out on the sidewalk.\n\nThey need to sell gift cards so we can share the experience with our friends and family.",
      "This café is genuinely one of the cutest spots I've studied at. I'm writing this review because I was searching for a new café to try between classes, and after some exploring, this one popped up. I checked Yelp for reviews on the space, drinks, and pastries but found little information online. Still, since I had already been to most cafés in Berkeley, I decided to give it a shot--and I'm so glad I did.\n\nThe moment I walked in, I smiled. The cozy lighting, bright red balloons, and beautifully displayed pastries created such a warm and inviting atmosphere. I ordered a café latte (solid 4/5 for taste and well-priced for Berkeley) and easily found a spacious three-person table to study at, as it wasn't too crowded. Right away, I noticed how attentive the staff was--one of the owners (as I learned later on) quickly cleaned up a nearby table and even set aside a forgotten water bottle in case the customer returned. Sure enough, when the customer came back looking for it, the owner immediately handed it to them.\n\nThe hospitality here is unmatched. The owner personally brought my drink to my table and even gave me a free pastry to try! I later learned that this is a family-run business owned by twin French-Algerian brothers, which made me appreciate the café even more. The sense of community was evident--one customer in a wheelchair came in for their birthday, and the owner helped them pick out the perfect cake. It was also great to see that the café is wheelchair accessible, making it a welcoming space for everyone.\n\nI love the ambiance, the kindness of the staff, and the study-friendly setup. For students and employees, it's a great spot to work, with affordable house coffee refills. My only critique? The brownie is a bit pricey at $6.50. But overall, I'll definitely be coming back!",
      "I stumbled upon this place while having lunch with a friend down the street. I was only going to look, but then I took a gander at the amazing pastries and croissants and was smitten. The service was top notch friendly and helpful. I couldn't decide what to try and ended up getting this cheese filled croissant on recommendation that was amazing. I have to go back to get more! I'm now obsessed. I also tried an apricot cheese croissant and a chocolate croissant and both were amazing. They were having a special on baklava on the counter and though I'm normally not a huge baklava fan, I bought a box of these and let me tell you, I'm now a baklava fan. They were nutty and gooey without being too sweet somehow. I loved them. I can't wait to go back here. Next time, I'm going to sit and try their espresso, and stay a while. Tres bien! C'est tres bon! Merci!"

      "One of my favorite coffee shops in Berkeley! This was my second time coming to Cafenated Coffee Co. and decided to try a new drink. I had a hot white mocha with oatmilk and it was really good. My boyfriend had a hot vanilla latte and he enjoyed his drink as well. We visited early on a Friday morning and it was quite packed inside. They also have plenty of outdoor seating in the back which would be nice on a warm day. Service was great and drinks came out pretty fast! Highly recommend if you're looking for a good coffee shop in Berkeley."

      "I'm so glad I stumbled across this cafe. Beautiful interior, wonderful ambiance, extremely friendly workers and owners- come support this small Palestinian-owned business! We tried three sandwiches- the Tuscan chicken, chicken supreme, and roast and toast special, and all were AMAZING. Hands down some of the best sandwiches I've ever had! The bread is fresh, and the flavors were delicious. The sun-dried tomatoes, paired with the unique balsamic glazes (grape and pomegranate), and Palestinian spices on the sandwiches were life-changing. The portions are fantastic as well- one sandwich is easily enough for two meals! The garlic sauce on the chicken supreme is phenomenal.\n\nThe Spanish lattes are beautifully decorated and delicious as well. Not too sweet! We also tried the knafeh with ice cream, which was unique and fun. Delicious with the pistachios!\n\nSafe to say, I will definitely be coming back. It's a great place to study, and the food, drinks, and experience is so worth it.",
      "You're going to likely need to hunt for a seat when you're here -- it's popular, and with good reason. The guys who run this place are awesome, and so is the grub. The atmosphere is chill as hell and I love working here. I love the croissant sandwiches -- at $8 per, they're pretty affordable! The coffee is great too. What are you waiting for? Check it out.",
      "This cafe has a lot of seating, outlets, and free wifi. We tried the za'atar and cheese croissant and it was really good. The Spanish hot chocolate was a pretty standard hot chocolate, but it was good! Workers were very friendly!"

      "A nice Peet's Coffee on the corner in Berkeley. I discover this location through Google. I decided to check out this place since I was at a Safeway. I order my drink through the app and instead of walking from Safeway to Peet's, I drove to this location.\n\nI was impress how fast my drink was prepare when I got there. The inside of Peet's looks small but I found out that the place was bigger as it look and also that I was able to access to their restroom.\n\nI was greeted when I got my drink and they said come again when I left. I was lucky I did not have to pay for parking at this location. Putting money in the meter doesn't start until 9am and I came here at 8:30.\n\nWhenever I am in the area I will check out Peet's again.",
      "Great employees, friendly and helpful. Seating area has 12 seats. 3 small 2 tops and then some bar areas to sit against the window. Perfect distance to the Claremont. Mobile order options, didn't eat the food but does have bakery options. Even has a bar menu if you're looking for an afternoon sip after a day!",
      "This is the place where Peets made a start. The first Peets in America. This is genesis to Starbucks . Excited to see and taste the original Peets Coffee in Berkeley. Great atmosphere and great history."

      "Probably one of the most aesthetic boba spots I've been to! If I needed a place to study or read, I'd go to Asha Tea House.\n\nBut the boba itself? Honestly... I was a bit disappointed. I ordered the Hong Kong milk tea, and I'm not sure if it was because I ordered less ice or if it was just an off day, but the flavor was more watery. The boba itself had a nice chew, but it didn't taste like anything. For the price, I'd have expected a higher quality drink.\n\nThat being said, if I was in the area and a craving, I'd still drop by. But I wouldn't go out of the way to get something here.",
      "Good quality matcha! I also love that there is the option to make it less sweet and with less ice. Ordering is pretty quick and easy through the ordering screen. To order loose-leaf tea, though, I believe I've had to order at the counter.\n\nThe space is great -- it fills up, but I personally haven't had trouble finding seating. There are large windows and plenty of natural light if you're reading while sipping on your tea. They do run out of pastries later in the day, so come early not to miss them!",
      "Thoroughly impressed with their high-quality teas and cozy atmosphere! The Hong Kong Milk Tea is amazing--it's rich, creamy, and has the perfect balance of sweetness. I also tried their matcha series, which is made with 100% stone-ground green tea and individually hand-whisked to order. The matcha latte was smooth and not overly sweet, allowing the prominent flavor of matcha to shine through. The tea house itself is beautifully designed, creating a relaxing and inviting space to enjoy your drink. If you like tea, check out Asha Tea House!"
